staging area wher git records the changes of certain files

there are two which files store 
-working directory
- git repository


GIT STATUS  : only worrks if git init starts 

to create git local repository : git init [it will start a master branch]

to create a main branch : git init -b main

---TO ADD FILES TI GIT---
PROJECT directoey had two parts
-woking firectory : it is before adding to LR
 -local repository(.git)

 first we need to add file to staging area
    git add FILE-name
    eg: git add git.txt
by this the file will be moved to staging area 
to remove from staging : git rm --cached <file>
 
Git follows CHECKSUM to track evry change and commit that occur

to commit the file into LR : git commit -m "meaage"

to skip the staging and commit: git commit a- -m 'mesg'

diff word: shows the changes that occurn in file
